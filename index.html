  <p>My name is Sydney Hawekotte, I am a senior at University of Miami. Despite all of the important skills I have learned in college, living away from home has given me something deeper: a newfound appreciation for the town I grew up in, Hollis, New Hampshire. The 603 is located on the New Hampshire and Massachusetts border, a mere hour from Boston. Hollis is also conveniently located a short drive from New Hampshire's coastal beaches and mountains. The town's small town quirks make it truly unique, and I cannot imagine growing up anywhere else. Whether you are thinking about moving to this quaint town or simply looking to learn more, navigate the site to learn more about the wonderful place I have been able to call home!</p>
