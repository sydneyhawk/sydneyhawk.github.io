<h1>Sydney Hawekotte</h1>
  <p>This is my <strong>first web page</strong>! It's very exciting.</p>
  <p>I am making it for my class <em>JMM341</em> at the University of Miami.</p>
  <p>I am taking this course because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm interested in this coding language.</li>
      <li>I worked with editing my team website for my internship over the summer, and it was fun!</li>
      <li>I need to take two electives for my Computer Science minor.</li>
    </ul>
