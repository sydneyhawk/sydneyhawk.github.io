    <h2>A Brief History...</h2>
      <p>The town of Hollis was incorporated into the New Hampshire province on April 3, 1746. At the time, Governer Benning Wentworth felt he owed the 1st Duke of Newcastle, Thomas Pelham-Holles, something in order to repay him for naming him the governor of the town. Thus, the town was originally named Holles. As time passed, both Holles and Hollis were used. The first family to reside in Hollis was Captain Peter Powers with his wife Anna and two kids in 1731. Peter Powers, one of Captain Peter's children, was the first person from the town to graduate college. He graduated from Harvard in 1754.</p>
